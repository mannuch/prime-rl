# Advanced

This page covers the specialized features layered on top of the core training stack: our custom model implementations (with EP for MoE families and CP for long-context training), multimodal training, LoRA training, and disaggregated prefill/decode inference. For developer-side workflows (adding new model architectures, debugging modeling code at small scale), see [Development](development.md).

## Custom Modeling

The trainer only runs `prime-rl`'s own model implementations, selected from the HF config type. Besides dense Llama, Qwen3 and Qwen3.5, these cover the families below. Other architectures fail at trainer setup.

| Family | HF config types | EP | CP |
|---|---|---|---|
| GLM-5 / GLM-5.2 (`glm_moe_dsa`) | `zai-org/GLM-5`, `zai-org/GLM-5-FP8`, `zai-org/GLM-5.2`, `zai-org/GLM-5.2-FP8` | ✅ | ✅ |
| Qwen3 MoE | `Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B`, … | ✅ | ✅ |
| Qwen3.5 MoE | `Qwen/Qwen3.5-35B-A3B`, … | ✅ | ✅ |
| Qwen3.5 VLMs | see [Multimodal training](#multimodal-training) | MoE only | ✅ |
| Laguna | `poolside/Laguna-XS.2` | ✅ | ✅ |
| MiniMax M2 | `MiniMax/MiniMax-M2` | ✅ | ✅ |
| Nemotron H | `nvidia/Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B`, … | ✅ | ❌ |
| Trinity (AFMoE) | `arcee-ai/Trinity-Mini`, … | ✅ | ✅ |
| GLM-4 / GLM-4.5 / INTELLECT-3 | `THUDM/GLM-4-9B-0414`, `zai-org/GLM-4.5`, `PrimeIntellect/INTELLECT-3`, … | ✅ | ✅ |
| GPT-OSS | `unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16`, … | ✅ | ✅ |
| DeepSeek V4 | `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731` | ✅ | ✅ |

GPT-OSS uses FlashAttention 4 with learned attention sinks. Training requires SM90 or SM100/SM110 GPUs
and a BF16 checkpoint such as `unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-BF16`; the original MXFP4 checkpoints are not supported.

### Low-precision training

Dense linear precision and routed-expert precision are configured independently. `[trainer.model.quantization]` applies only to dense `Linear` modules:

- `type = "fp8"` — DeepGEMM FP8 blockwise linears (requires SM90+).
- `type = "mxfp8"` — torchao MXFP8 linears (requires SM100). `recipe` is `mxfp8_rceil` or `mxfp8_rceil_wgrad_with_hp`.

`[trainer.model.moe.compute]` selects routed-expert compute independently:

- `type = "bf16"` (default), with `backend = "torch"` (default) or `"sonicmoe"`.
- `type = "deepgemm_fp8"` (requires DeepGEMM and SM90+)
- `type = "mxfp8"` (requires `prime-kernels`, torchao, and SM100)

SonicMoE uses the upstream `sonic-moe` package (`uv sync --extra sonic-moe`) for fused BF16 expert computation. The supported model is Qwen3 MoE with the `gate_up` model fusion enabled. Backend selection requires fused gate/up weights, standard SwiGLU, and bias-free experts; incompatible expert structures raise an error during setup. It uses the same router and local, torch EP, or DeepEP dispatch as other compute backends:

```toml
[trainer.model]
name = "Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B"
ep = 2

[trainer.model.fusions]
enabled = ["gate_up"]

[trainer.model.moe.compute]
type = "bf16"
backend = "sonicmoe"

[trainer.model.moe.dispatch]
type = "torch"
```

```toml
[trainer.model.quantization]
type = "mxfp8"
recipe = "mxfp8_rceil"

[trainer.model.moe.compute]
type = "mxfp8"
recipe = "mxfp8_rceil"

[trainer.model.moe.dispatch]
type = "torch"
transport = "mxfp8"
```

All MoE compute backends accept `apply_to`:

- `"all"` (default) applies the backend to all expert groups.
- `"85%"` applies it to the first 85% of model layers, rounded down. For a 48-layer model, this selects layers 0–39.
- `[0, 1, 2, 3]` selects explicit zero-based model layer indices; `[]` selects none.

Percentages must be between 0% and 100%; explicit indices must be within the model's layer count. Non-MoE blocks in hybrid models count toward layer indices and percentages. Each selected layer uses the backend for all its routed experts. Other expert groups use BF16 compute and BF16 token transport while retaining the configured dispatch backend and expert parallelism. Dense linear quantization is configured separately.

For example, this selects routed experts in Qwen3's first four model layers:

```toml
[trainer.model.moe.compute]
type = "mxfp8"
apply_to = [0, 1, 2, 3]
```

Backend shape checks and token alignment apply only to the selected compute path.

In RL runs, configure the same precision selection for rollouts. Inference module names can differ from the trainer's names, and inference precision is configured explicitly, not inferred from `apply_to`. Check the selected modules on both sides before comparing trainer and rollout logprobs.

GLM-5.2 adds IndexShare: the DSA sparse-attention indexer runs only on a subset of layers and the remaining layers reuse the cached top-k indices. The trainer reads this schedule from the model's `indexer_types` config field and enables the index cache automatically, so no extra config is needed. To override the schedule manually, set `[trainer.model.index_cache]` (`topk_freq` or `topk_pattern`).

### Expert Parallelism Backends

`[trainer.model.moe.dispatch]` selects how routed tokens are dispatched and combined:

- **`torch`** (default): torch all-to-all with `transport = "bf16"` or, when MXFP8 expert compute is selected, `transport = "mxfp8"` on SM100.
- **`deepep`**: DeepEP custom dispatch/combine kernels. Set `num_sms` and optional `token_chunk_size` in the same table. Pre-built H100/H200 binaries use CUDA 13.0 and are installed by `uv sync --all-extras`.

```toml
[trainer.model.moe.dispatch]
type = "deepep"
num_sms = 20
token_chunk_size = 4096
```

With DeepEP, gradient clipping is currently not supported. (`optim.max_norm` is set to `None` automatically.)

### Runtime Fusions

`model.fusions` packs parameters that are always computed together into one tensor, turning several GEMMs into one. Both fusions are on by default:

- `gate_up` — each gated MoE expert's `gate_proj` and `up_proj` become one `[num_experts, 2 * intermediate_size, hidden_size]` weight, halving the routed-expert grouped GEMMs.
- `qkv` — an attention layer's `q_proj`, `k_proj` and `v_proj` (and their biases) become one linear layer.

```toml
[trainer.model.fusions]
enabled = ["gate_up", "qkv"]   # [] disables
```

Fusions are runtime-only. Checkpoints keep the canonical parameter names and shapes, so a run can turn a fusion on or off at any point and still load its own checkpoints, and exported weights are unaffected. Only modules that support a fusion are packed; a requested fusion that no module supports logs a warning and is skipped. Fusions are skipped when LoRA is enabled.

Muon receives the packed layout as matrix partitions and orthogonalizes each logical matrix on its own, so a packed parameter trains exactly as the parameters it replaces would — including per-projection learning-rate scaling for grouped-query attention — while keeping a single momentum tensor.

The experimental `shard_fused_on_dim1 = true` shards fused 2-D weights along dim 1 under FSDP, which makes weight loading and checkpointing zero-copy: fused weights and their optimizer state are read and written in place rather than assembled into a full copy on each rank first. It requires `hidden_size` to be divisible by the FSDP shard mesh size.

## Multimodal Training

### Supported Families

The built-in VLM registry covers:

| Family | `model_type` | Vision attr | LM attr |
|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3.5 | `qwen3_5` | `model.visual` | `model.language_model` |
| Qwen3.5-MoE | `qwen3_5_moe` | `model.visual` | `model.language_model` |

### Enabling VLM Mode

Add `[model.vlm]` and bfloat16 dtypes:

```toml
[model]
name = "Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B"
optimization_dtype = "bfloat16"
reduce_dtype = "bfloat16"

[model.vlm]
vision_encoder_attr = "model.visual"
language_model_attr = "model.language_model"
# freeze_vision_encoder = true  # default; set false to fine-tune the encoder
```

The weight-broadcast key prefix is derived as `{language_model_attr}.layers.` automatically.

VLM training requires a registered custom PrimeRL implementation.

### Limitations

- **Vision encoder frozen by default.** The default LoRA targets do not match Qwen3.5 vision modules. Set `freeze_vision_encoder = false` to fine-tune the encoder; this is incompatible with LoRA because LoRA freezes all non-adapter parameters.
- **bfloat16 mandatory.** The trainer config validator refuses any other `optimization_dtype` / `reduce_dtype` for VLMs — vLLM serves VLMs in bfloat16 and a mismatch breaks the importance ratio.
- **Higher KL mismatch with multi-image inputs.** Expect noisier `mismatch_kl` than text-only; this is from minor numerical differences between the trainer's and vLLM's image processing.
- **Images aren't logged to monitors.** Sample logging captures the prompt text but not the actual images.

## LoRA Training

LoRA is enabled by adding `[model.lora]`:

```toml
[model.lora]
rank = 16
alpha = 32
dropout = 0.0
```

`target_modules` defaults to a reasonable cross-family set (`q_proj`, `k_proj`, `v_proj`, `o_proj`, `gate_proj`, `up_proj`, `down_proj`, `experts`, plus a few latent-projection names for Nemotron). Unknown names are silently ignored, so the defaults work across architectures. Add architecture-specific names to extend coverage (e.g. `in_proj` / `out_proj` for Mamba).

LoRA is supported across SFT and RL. NCCL weight broadcast is **not** supported with LoRA — the default NCCL transport automatically falls back to filesystem when LoRA is enabled. Broadcast dirs of LoRA runs contain the raw adapter (`adapter_model.safetensors` + `adapter_config.json`). With LoRA on, the inference server registers the adapter under the model name and serves the base model as `<model>-base`.

## Disaggregated Prefill/Decode Inference

For large MoE serving, splitting prefill and decode onto separate vLLM groups can substantially improve throughput. Pick the prefill:decode ratio based on workload shape:

| Workload | P:D ratio | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Agentic (SWE, Lean) | 3:1 | Long growing contexts → prefill-heavy |
| Non-agentic (math, chat) | 1:2 | Short prompts, long generations → decode-heavy |

Example config: [`examples/advanced/glm-5.3/swe.toml`](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-rl/blob/main/examples/advanced/glm-5.3/swe.toml) — full RL run on `GLM-5` with P/D disaggregation behind a `vllm-router`, FP8 inference, and NCCL weight broadcast, paired with an inference config from [`examples/advanced/glm-5.3/infer/`](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-rl/tree/main/examples/advanced/glm-5.3/infer).

Monitor live queue depths to detect imbalance:

```bash
curl -s http://<prefill_node>:8100/metrics | grep num_requests_waiting
curl -s http://<decode_node>:8200/metrics | grep num_requests_waiting
```

If prefill queues and decode is idle, add prefill nodes (and vice versa).

**Required setup for disaggregated P/D (NIXL/UCX).** The pip-wheel NIXL's bundled UCX segfaults on the prefill→decode KV transfer (`signal 11: invalid permissions for mapped object` in `libucs.so`) — reproduced on vLLM 0.22 and 0.23, with/without mooncake, with/without llm-d. Building NIXL against UCX 1.19.x from source is therefore **required** (not optional) for disaggregated P/D.

```bash
salloc -N 1 --gres=gpu:1 bash -c 'bash scripts/install_nixl_from_source.sh'
uv pip install --reinstall --no-deps deps/nixl_cu13-*.whl
```

The script writes UCX 1.19 to `third_party/ucx/`; the bundled sbatch templates prepend it to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` so it overrides the system version. Re-run both commands after every `uv sync`, since the lock pins the wheel.
